            <p>
            I hope you always remember that you are loved beyond words, seen without explanation, and understood without having to ask. You mean more to me than you know.
            </p>


            <p>
                I may not have been there to witness every version of you that learned how to survive, the ones that broke quietly, and the ones that stayed even when they shouldn't have.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                I will be here when you're gentle and mostly won't leave when you're exhausted of being strong. I will be here when you're unsure and when uncertainty frightens you. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Even if this is my first time being here.I assure that this will not be shallow, and I assure you that it will always be unscathed and fervent.
            </p>

            <p>I will be here in every version of you in this life</p>

            <p>If you change, I'll stay.<br>If you break, I'll sit with you. <br> If you grow, I'll grow with you.
